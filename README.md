## Usage
There actual data collection is done using two tools:
#1. scraping_with_selenium.py#
Uses Selenium to collect links to the property ads from ImmoWeb-site. Selects 
automaticly property type (house/apartment) and one out of 20 subtype (penthouse, 
dublex, single etc). Futhermore the tool excludes the life annuity sales. The tool
can be started with command: 'python scraping_with_selenium.py'

Scraping tool will create text-files to ./data/ -directory, one file for each subtype and 
the file is named accordingly (for ex. HOUSE_VILLAS.txt). Tool is also creating log file
that contains information how many properties was found and if there were any errors. When 
the programn has finished html_to_attributes.py can be started
#2. html_to_attributes.py#
This tool uses the links that were created by Selenium tool. It reads the files created by
Selenium tool and by using BeautifulSoup downloads all the attributes for properties. Tool can be 
started in terminal with command:
'python html_to_attributes.py <filename>'
filename is one of those files that Selenium tool generated (for ex. python html_to_attributes.py HOUSE_VILLAS.txt). 
Please, note that it's possible to open several terminal and load different files with the tool from there. The result 
will be written to a binary files. 
#3 file_read_example
This tool reads all the binary files, and modifies the data to proper format for machine learning. It also creates CSV file.
